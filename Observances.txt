1) When sorting the schools based on student size, the overall passing rate for the smaller schools
was greater than the overall passing rates of the larger schools. 

2) When examining school spending and allocation per student, the $550-$600 spend per student ended up 
with a higher overall passing rate than spending $650-$1100 per kid. Efficiency in spending is more 
important than simply pressing more money into each kid.
